# FoodBot
FoodBot is an intelligent chatbot system designed to simplify food delivery by combining natural language processing, backend development, and database management. Built using Dialogflow, it understands user inputs, identifies intents, and manages conversations effectively. The backend, developed with Python and FastAPI, handles user requests, processes data, and ensures smooth communication between the chatbot and users.

The system integrates a MySQL database to store and manage crucial data like user profiles, order histories, and menu items, enabling personalized and efficient interactions. This project demonstrates essential concepts like intent recognition, context management, and real-time communication, providing a user-friendly and advanced food delivery experience.
